# DurocherProjectionMedian
R Package for calculating the Durocher Projection Median
Use function dpm to compute the projection median
Method 1 corresponds to method 1 in Durochet et al 2017 "The projection median as a weights average"
Method 2 is method 2
Exact2D corresponds to the exact method, via the algorithm in "Computable Robust Methods..."
